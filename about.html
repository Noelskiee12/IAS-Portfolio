        <h2>All ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Noel M. Polidario Jr., 20 years old, and a student at New Era University. 
            Since I was a kid, I’ve loved computers and the tech world, inspired by my father’s work in computers. 
            My interests include coding, video editing, photography, and playing online games. 
            I enjoy learning new skills, creating digital projects, 
            and exploring creative ways to combine technology and art..</p>

        <p>This website is dedicated to my digital notes from my AIS course, where I carefully record lessons, exercises, and important concepts to help me study effectively. 
            During my Senior High School years, 
            I was fascinated by cybersecurity, amazed by how hacking works and how systems can be protected, which sparked my interest in tech even further. 
            Through this portfolio, I aim to organize and share my learning journey, showcasing the skills and knowledge I acquire in my AIS course. 
            It reflects my dedication to technology, learning, and building a strong foundation for future projects in the digital world.</p>
