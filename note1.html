    <h2>IMPORTANCE OF IT SECURITY</h2>
    <p>
        Information assurance practice of assuring information and managing risks related 
        to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data, including 
        protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality 
        of user data.
    </p>

    <h2>VIOLATION OF SECURITY PRINCIPLE</h2>

    <h3>CIA</h3>
    <p>— is a guiding model in information security. A comprehensive information security strategy includes policies and security controls that minimize threats to these three crucial components.</p>

    <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
    <p>— Keeping information <strong>secret</strong> and accessible only to authorized people.</p>

    <h4>Integrity</h4>
    <p>— Keeping information <strong>accurate</strong> and <strong>unchanged</strong> unless modified by authorized users.</p>

    <h4>Availability</h4>
    <p>— Making sure information and systems are <strong>accessible</strong> when needed.</p>


    <h2>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN IT SECURITY</h2>

    <h3>WHAT IS CYBERSECURITY</h3>
    <p>— Practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access.</p>

    <h3>Red vs Blue Team</h3>

    <p><strong>Red</strong> — They simulate real-world cyberattacks to find weaknesses in systems. (offense)</p>
    <p><strong>Blue</strong> — They detect, respond to, and protect against attacks from the Red Team. (defense)</p>

    <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Growing Demand</li>
        <li>Flexible Work Enviroment</li>
        <li>Competitive Salaries</li>
        <li>Increased Investment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security Operational Center</h3>
    <p>— Monitors and defends systems from cyber threats.</p>

    <h3>Three Pillars of Cybersecurity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>People</strong> are crucial for strong cybersecurity.</li>
        <li><strong>Processes</strong> define security procedures and responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong> provides tools to protect systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All three pillars are essential for effective defense.</p>

    <h3>Vulnerability Scanning</h3>
    <p>— Automatically <strong>finds weaknesses</strong> in systems.</p>

    <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
    <p>— <strong>Tries to exploit</strong> those weaknesses to see how far an attacker could go.</p>
